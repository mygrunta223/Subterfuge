# Subterfuge - Ultimate Hacker Simulator

## Project Overview
A fun terminal-based "hacker simulator" that creates the illusion of doing serious computational work with Matrix-style effects, progress bars, fake logs, and random code snippets. Pure entertainment/educational tool!

## Current Features (v3.0.0)
- ✅ Matrix rain effect - falling characters in green/cyan
- ✅ Animated progress bars with random operations
- ✅ Scrolling code snippets (Python, JS, SQL, Docker, etc.)
- ✅ Fake log messages with timestamps and IPs
- ✅ System stats monitor (CPU, memory, network, threads)
- ✅ File operation simulations (encrypt, decrypt, compile)
- ✅ Network scanner with port discovery and vulnerability detection
- ✅ Terminal breach sequence - movie-style hacking with access levels
- ✅ Glitch effects - distorted text animations
- ✅ Data stream interception - packet capture simulation
- ✅ Binary cascade - falling binary numbers
- ✅ Continuous random operation loop
- ✅ Graceful keyboard interrupt handling
- ✅ Windows batch file launcher for easy execution
- ✅ **NEW:** WarGames WOPR dialogue - "Shall we play a game?"
- ✅ **NEW:** Radar sweep animation with contact detection
- ✅ **NEW:** Multiple spinner styles (dots, arrows, circles, blocks)
- ✅ **NEW:** ASCII art gallery (WOPR, Matrix, Skull, Cyber logos)
- ✅ **NEW:** Themed scenarios (WarGames, Matrix, Cyberpunk/Mr. Robot)

## Planned Features
### High Priority
1. ~~**Network scanning simulations**~~ ✅ DONE
2. ~~**Terminal hacking sequences**~~ ✅ DONE
3. ~~**More sophisticated animations**~~ ✅ DONE
4. **Interactive menu mode** - Choose specific effects or scenarios
5. **Achievement/stats tracking** - Track operations across sessions

### Future Ideas
- Database queries with fake results
- ASCII art banners
- Sound effects (terminal beeps)
- Command-line arguments for different modes
- Save/replay sequences

## Development Session Notes

### Session 1 - Initial Build
- Created core HackerSimulator class
- Implemented basic visual effects
- Added color support with ANSI codes
- Built operation randomization system

### Session 2 - Enhancement Phase
**Date:** 2025-11-23
**Focus:** Adding network scanning, hacking sequences, and advanced animations

**Completed:**
- [x] Add network scanner module with port scanning, service detection, and vulnerability assessment
- [x] Create terminal hacking sequence with progressive access level breaching
- [x] Implement new animation effects (glitch, data stream, binary cascade)
- [x] Test integration with existing features

**New Features Added:**
1. **Network Scanner** - Scans random IPs for open ports (FTP, SSH, HTTP, MySQL, etc.), displays service info, and runs vulnerability assessments with CVE references
2. **Terminal Breach** - Movie-style hacking sequence that progresses through 5 access levels (Public → User → Admin → Root → Kernel) with realistic attack methods
3. **Glitch Effect** - Text distortion animation for dramatic moments
4. **Data Stream** - High-speed packet/frame interception display with checksums
5. **Binary Cascade** - Falling binary numbers for that authentic hacker aesthetic

### Session 3 - Movie Magic & Visual Effects
**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Focus:** WarGames tribute, ASCII art, radar systems, and themed scenarios

**Completed:**
- [x] WarGames WOPR dialogue with "Shall we play a game?" sequence
- [x] Radar sweep animation with contact detection
- [x] Multiple loading spinner styles (7 different types)
- [x] ASCII art gallery (WOPR, Matrix, Skull, Cyber logos)
- [x] Themed scenario system (WarGames, Matrix, Cyberpunk)

**New Features Added:**
1. **WOPR Dialogue** - Full WarGames tribute including NORAD connection, game selection, and "the only winning move" conclusion
2. **Radar Sweep** - Animated radar display with contact detection, bearings, and range information
3. **Spinner Gallery** - 7 different animated spinner styles (dots, lines, arrows, pulses, boxes, circles, blocks)
4. **ASCII Art** - Multiple themed banners that display randomly
5. **Themed Scenarios** - Complete narrative-driven sequences for WarGames, The Matrix, and Cyberpunk/Mr. Robot themes

## Technical Notes
- Uses Python 3 with standard library only
- ANSI color codes for terminal styling
- Threading-ready architecture
- Cross-platform compatible (tested on Windows)

## Usage
```bash
python subterfuge.py
```
